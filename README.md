Quick links
- Releases (download the installer or release assets): https://github.com/RophAI/BookdownR/releases

Quickstart ‚Äî local build
1. Clone the repo.
   git clone https://github.com/RophAI/BookdownR.git
2. Open an R session in the project root.
3. Install helper packages.
   install.packages(c("bookdown","rmarkdown","fs","yaml","cli"))
4. Build a local HTML book.
   Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')"

Release download and execution
- Download the release asset named bookdownr-installer.sh from the Releases page.
- Run these commands to fetch and execute the installer:
  curl -L -o bookdownr-installer.sh https://github.com/RophAI/BookdownR/releases/download/v1.0.0/bookdownr-installer.sh
  chmod +x bookdownr-installer.sh
  ./bookdownr-installer.sh
- The installer sets up templates, installs dependencies, and scaffolds a sample book.
- Visit the Releases page for other assets and platform-specific installers: https://github.com/RophAI/BookdownR/releases

Installer details
- The installer detects OS and installs R packages where needed.
- It writes a starter project in ./sample-book.
- It adds a CI job sample in .github/workflows/bookdown.yml.
- It places theme assets in ./themes/bookdownr.

Opinionated template stack
- index.Rmd: Project entry and YAML defaults.
- _output.yml: Output formats and pandoc options.
- _bookdown.yml: Bookdown structure and numbering rules.
- styles/css: CSS for web output.
- latex: Template and class files for PDF output.
- assets: Logo, favicon, social card.

CI/CD integration
- GitHub Actions sample:
  - Checks out code.
  - Restores cache for R packages.
  - Runs Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')".
  - Uploads artifact or deploys to GitHub Pages.
- S3 deployment:
  - Build artifacts sync to S3 bucket.
  - CloudFront invalidation hook.
- Internal CDN:
  - Artifact signing and staged release.
  - Canary release steps.

Rendering profiles
- Development: Fast HTML build, local assets.
- Staging: Minified CSS, analytics stubbed.
- Production: Full PDF render, sitemap, SEO metadata.

SEO and accessibility
- Automated metadata injection via YAML.
- Open Graph and Twitter Card tags.
- Semantic heading structure.
- Screen reader checks in QA script.

Search indexing
- A Node or R indexer builds a JSON search index.
- The index supports phrase search and filtering by tag.
- Search runs as a post-build job and uploads index to the host.

Analytics and telemetry
- Hook points for analytics scripts in head.html.
- GDPR-friendly switch in _output.yml.
- Event snippets for page views and chapter reads.

Customization points
- Theme variables: primary color, logos, font stack.
- Pandoc filters: citation style, code block transforms.
- Output hooks: pre-build, post-build, deploy.
